V 0.2 - 26/02/2013
==================
New release to add charting to the page

Adds: 
 - Chart for points vs. time
 - Chart for tickets vs. time

Does not do:
 - Automagically detecting latest milestone
 - Track velocity
 - Legacy pages will still show most up to date charts, sorry
 - Track people in (Though we might be able to nick that from Google Calendars one day)

V 0.1 - 25/02/2013
==================
Initial release.

Does:
 - The generated pages are being served (or should be) on a SimpleHTTPServer on Pooh, in /home/TomB/milestone_reporting/publish
 - The python script (and associated text files) live in /home/TomB/milestone_reporting/publish
 - They also live in svn, here: http://tigger.teamrubber.com/svn/repos/delia/teamrubber.smrt
 - The script gets run every weekday at 00:01 by crontab
 - You have to manually update the milestone.txt (in the folder on pooh, and svn) each time the milestone changes, sorry!
 - The PlanIO user it's using while running on Pooh is a Read Only user I created especially for this job
 - You can use your own user locally if you like
 - It writes a .csv file named after the milestone each day, with the summary data (first table)

Does not:
 - Clever stuff
 - Aggregation
 - Making you tea
 - Building charts for you (Though the .csv file could be used for that in future, when I find time)
 - Calculating what milestone we're on
 - Doing work for you
